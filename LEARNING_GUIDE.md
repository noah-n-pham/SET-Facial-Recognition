# Face Recognition Learning Guide

**Time to Complete:** 6-8 hours  
**What You'll Build:** A complete real-time facial recognition system  
**Learning Method:** Implement code step-by-step by filling in TODOs

---

## 🎯 Overview

### What You'll Learn

1. **Face Detection** - Finding faces in images using YuNet
2. **Face Embeddings** - Converting faces into 512-dimensional vectors
3. **Similarity Matching** - Recognizing people by comparing embeddings
4. **Pretrained Models** - Using production-ready models (industry standard)
5. **Real-Time Systems** - Processing video at 30+ FPS
6. **Hardware Deployment** - Running on Jetson Nano + Arduino

### The Big Picture

```
Camera → Face Detection → Crop Face → Extract Embedding → Compare with Database → Identify Person
         (YuNet)                      (MobileFaceNet)      (Cosine Similarity)
```

**Key Insight:** Face recognition is just comparing 512 numbers!

---

## 📚 Core Concepts (Read This First!)

### Concept 1: Face Detection vs Face Recognition

**Face Detection** = Finding WHERE faces are in an image  
**Face Recognition** = Identifying WHO the face belongs to

They're different problems requiring different approaches.

### Concept 2: What Are Embeddings?

An **embedding** is a list of 512 numbers that uniquely represents a face.

```python
face_image → Neural Network → [0.234, -0.123, 0.567, ..., 0.891]  # 512 numbers
                                        ↑
                                   This is the embedding!
```

**Why embeddings?**
- Similar faces → Similar embeddings
- Different faces → Different embeddings  
- Easy to compare: just compute similarity between number lists!

**Example:**
```python
ben_embedding    = [0.2, 0.5, -0.3, ...]  # 512 numbers
james_embedding  = [0.8, 0.1, -0.7, ...]  # 512 numbers

# Compare using dot product (cosine similarity)
similarity = np.dot(ben_embedding, james_embedding)  # 0.34 (different people)

# Compare Ben with himself
similarity = np.dot(ben_embedding, ben_embedding)  # 1.0 (same person!)
```

### Concept 3: Pretrained Models

We're using **MobileFaceNet from InsightFace** - a model trained on millions of faces.

**Why not train our own?**
- Training requires: millions of images, expensive GPUs, weeks of time
- Pretrained models are already excellent
- This is standard practice in industry
- We can focus on building the system, not the model

**Analogy:** Using a pretrained model is like using a calculator instead of building one from scratch. You still need to understand what it does, but you don't need to build the internals.

### Concept 4: Cosine Similarity

How do we measure if two embeddings are similar?

**Cosine Similarity** = Dot product of normalized vectors

```python
# Embeddings are normalized (length = 1.0)
# So dot product gives similarity from -1 to 1:
#   1.0  = identical faces
#   0.6+ = probably same person  
#   0.3  = different people
#  -1.0  = completely different
```

**The threshold (usually 0.6) determines recognition:**
- Higher threshold (0.8) = More strict, fewer false positives
- Lower threshold (0.4) = More lenient, fewer false negatives

---

## 📦 Phase 1: Load Pretrained Model (1 hour)

### 🧠 Concept: Pretrained Models

MobileFaceNet is a lightweight neural network trained on millions of faces. It converts face images into 512-dimensional embeddings.

**Architecture:** 
- Input: 112x112 RGB face image
- Output: 512-dimensional normalized embedding
- Parameters: ~1 million (10x smaller than ResNet-18)
- Trained on: Millions of faces from multiple datasets

**Why MobileFaceNet?**
- Optimized for mobile/edge devices
- Fast inference (~20ms on CPU)
- High accuracy
- Industry-proven

### 📝 Implementation

**File:** `models/face_model.py`

**Your Task:** Implement the FaceEmbeddingModel class that wraps InsightFace's pretrained model.

#### TODO 1: Initialize the Model

Navigate to `models/face_model.py` and find:

```python
def __init__(self, model_name='buffalo_l', device='cpu'):
    # TODO 1: Initialize InsightFace FaceAnalysis
```

**What to implement:**
1. Import FaceAnalysis from insightface
2. Create app = FaceAnalysis(name=model_name)
3. Prepare model with app.prepare(ctx_id=-1 for CPU, 0 for GPU)
4. Store as self.app

**Reasoning:**
- `FaceAnalysis` is InsightFace's high-level API
- It includes both face detection and recognition
- `buffalo_l` is the model pack name (large, accurate version)
- `ctx_id=-1` means CPU, `ctx_id=0` means GPU 0

**Hint:** Check InsightFace documentation for exact syntax.

#### TODO 2: Convert BGR to RGB

```python
def extract_embedding(self, face_img):
    # TODO 2: Convert BGR to RGB
```

**What to implement:**
1. Convert BGR to RGB (OpenCV uses BGR, InsightFace expects RGB)
2. Call self.app.get(face_rgb) to detect faces
3. Check if any faces detected (len(faces) > 0)
4. Return faces[0].embedding (already normalized)
5. Return None if no face detected

**Reasoning:**
- Color space conversion is necessary (BGR vs RGB)
- OpenCV uses BGR, InsightFace expects RGB
- Use cv2.cvtColor() with cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB

#### TODO 3: Extract Embedding from Face Image

```python
    # TODO 3: Detect face and extract embedding
```

**What to implement:**
1. Call self.app.get(face_rgb) to detect faces
2. Check if any faces detected (len(faces) > 0)
3. Return faces[0].embedding (already normalized)
4. Return None if no face detected

**Reasoning:**
- .get() returns list of detected faces with embeddings
- Each face object has .embedding attribute
- InsightFace automatically normalizes embeddings to unit length

**Test your implementation:**
```bash
python models/face_model.py
# Expected: Loads model, extracts embedding, shows shape [512]
```

---

## 📦 Phase 2: Build Face Database (1-2 hours)

### 🧠 Concept: Reference Embeddings

To recognize people, we need a **reference database**:
- For each person, store their average embedding
- At runtime, compare new faces against these references
- Best match above threshold = recognized!

**Why average multiple photos?**
- Reduces noise from single bad photo
- Captures variation (different angles, lighting)
- More robust recognition

**Database format:**
```python
reference_embeddings = np.array([
    [0.2, 0.5, ...],  # Ben's average embedding
    [0.8, 0.1, ...],  # James's average embedding
    ...
])  # Shape: [num_people, 512]

label_names = ['ben', 'james', ...]
```

### 📝 Implementation Part A: Face Detection Wrapper

**File:** `utils/face_detector.py`

**Your Task:** Wrap YuNet detector for easy use.

#### TODO 4: Initialize YuNet

```python
def __init__(self, model_path, conf_threshold=0.7):
    # TODO 4: Create YuNet face detector
```

**What to implement:**
1. Use cv2.FaceDetectorYN.create()
2. Set model_path, score_threshold, nms_threshold
3. Default input size (320, 320)

**Reasoning:**
- YuNet is a fast, accurate face detector
- score_threshold filters weak detections
- nms_threshold controls overlap between detections

#### TODO 5: Detect Faces in Frame

```python
def detect(self, frame):
    # TODO 5: Detect faces and return bounding boxes
```

**What to implement:**
1. Get frame dimensions
2. Update detector input size: self.detector.setInputSize()
3. Call self.detector.detect(frame)
4. Parse results: extract bounding boxes [x, y, w, h]
5. Return list of bounding boxes

**Reasoning:**
- Input size must match frame size for accurate detection
- YuNet returns complex array - we simplify to just boxes
- Empty list if no faces detected

### 📝 Implementation Part B: Collect Face Photos

**File:** `data/face_capture.py`

**Your Task:** Implement webcam capture to collect photos of each team member.

#### TODO 6: Initialize Webcam

```python
def __init__(self, output_dir='data/raw/Dataset'):
    # TODO 6: Initialize webcam and face detector
```

**What to implement:**
1. Create cv2.VideoCapture(0) for webcam
2. Load YuNet face detector (see utils/face_detector.py)
3. Create output directory with Path.mkdir()

**Reasoning:**
- VideoCapture(0) opens default webcam
- We need face detector to show bounding boxes while capturing
- Organized folder structure: data/raw/Dataset/person_name/

#### TODO 7: Capture Photos for Person

```python
def capture_person(self, person_name, num_photos=20):
    # TODO 7: Capture photos when user presses SPACE
```

**What to implement:**
1. Create folder for this person
2. Loop: read frame, detect face, show with bounding box
3. When SPACE pressed: save frame as person_name_N.jpg
4. Stop when num_photos reached or ESC pressed

**Reasoning:**
- Multiple photos per person improves recognition
- Visual feedback (bounding box) helps user position correctly
- SPACE to capture gives user control over quality

**Test your implementation:**
```bash
python data/face_capture.py
# Capture 20 photos for each team member
```

### 📝 Implementation Part C: Generate Embeddings

**File:** `core/generate_embeddings.py`

**Your Task:** Extract embeddings from collected photos and create reference database.

#### TODO 8: Load Model and Dataset

```python
def generate_reference_embeddings(dataset_path, output_path):
    # TODO 8: Initialize model and find all person folders
```

**What to implement:**
1. Load FaceEmbeddingModel
2. Get all subdirectories in dataset_path (each is a person)
3. Sort them for consistent ordering

**Reasoning:**
- Model loads pretrained weights
- Each folder = one person
- Consistent ordering ensures label IDs match across runs

#### TODO 9: Extract Embeddings for Each Person

```python
for person_folder in person_folders:
    # TODO 9: Process all images for this person
```

**What to implement:**
1. Get person name from folder name
2. Find all .jpg/.png images in folder
3. For each image:
   - Load with cv2.imread()
   - Extract embedding with model.extract_embedding()
   - Store if not None
4. Average all embeddings for this person
5. Re-normalize averaged embedding (divide by L2 norm)
6. Append to reference list

**Reasoning:**
- Some images may fail (no face detected) - skip them
- Averaging reduces noise from individual photos
- Must re-normalize after averaging (averaging changes length)
- Order of processing determines label IDs (0, 1, 2, ...)

**Key Concept - Why Normalize?**
```python
emb1 = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, ...]  # Length = 0.866
emb2 = [0.4, 0.6, 0.8, ...]  # Length = 1.08

# If we compare unnormalized:
similarity = np.dot(emb1, emb2)  # Influenced by length!

# After normalization:
emb1_norm = emb1 / np.linalg.norm(emb1)  # Length = 1.0
emb2_norm = emb2 / np.linalg.norm(emb2)  # Length = 1.0
similarity = np.dot(emb1_norm, emb2_norm)  # Pure angle comparison!
```

#### TODO 10: Save Reference Database

```python
# TODO 10: Save embeddings array and label names
```

**What to implement:**
1. Convert list of embeddings to numpy array [num_people, 512]
2. Save with np.save(output_path, embeddings_array)
3. Save label names to text file (one per line)

**Test your implementation:**
```bash
python core/generate_embeddings.py
# Expected: Creates models/reference_embeddings.npy and models/label_names.txt
```

## 📦 Phase 3: Real-Time Face Recognition (2-3 hours)

### 🧠 Concept: Recognition Pipeline

```
Frame from Webcam
    ↓
Face Detection (YuNet) - Find bounding box
    ↓
Crop Face - Extract face region
    ↓
Extract Embedding (MobileFaceNet) - Get 512 numbers
    ↓
Compare with References - Compute similarities
    ↓
Find Best Match - argmax(similarities)
    ↓
Threshold Check - If similarity > 0.6, recognized!
    ↓
Display Result - Draw name and confidence
```

**Performance considerations:**
- Face detection: ~10ms
- Embedding extraction: ~20ms  
- Similarity comparison: <1ms
- Total: ~30ms = 30+ FPS ✅

### 📝 Implementation: Recognition System

**File:** `core/face_recognizer.py`

**Your Task:** Implement the complete recognition system.

#### TODO 11: Initialize Recognition System

```python
def __init__(self, model_path, reference_path, labels_path):
    # TODO 11: Load model, detector, and reference database
```

**What to implement:**
1. Load FaceEmbeddingModel
2. Load FaceDetector
3. Load reference embeddings from .npy file
4. Load label names from text file
5. Set similarity threshold (0.6 default)

**Reasoning:**
- All components loaded once at initialization
- Reference database loaded into memory for fast comparison
- Threshold can be tuned based on accuracy requirements

#### TODO 12: Recognize Face

```python
def recognize_face(self, face_img):
    # TODO 12: Extract embedding and find best match
```

**What to implement:**
1. Extract embedding from face_img
2. Return "Unknown" if embedding is None
3. Compute similarities with all references:
   ```python
   similarities = embedding @ self.reference_embeddings.T
   ```
4. Find index of maximum similarity
5. Get corresponding label name
6. If similarity > threshold, return (name, similarity)
7. Else return ("Unknown", similarity)

**Reasoning:**
- Matrix multiplication gives all similarities at once (fast!)
- argmax finds best match
- Threshold prevents false positives
- Return similarity score for confidence display

**Key Concept - Matrix Multiplication:**
```python
# Efficient way to compute all similarities at once
query = [512]              # Your face embedding
references = [9, 512]      # Database of 9 people

# This:
similarities = query @ references.T  # [9] similarities

# Is equivalent to:
similarities = []
for ref in references:
    sim = np.dot(query, ref)
    similarities.append(sim)

# But matrix version is 10x faster!
```

#### TODO 13: Main Recognition Loop

```python
def run_webcam(self, camera_id=0):
    # TODO 13: Main loop for real-time recognition
```

**What to implement:**
1. Open webcam with cv2.VideoCapture()
2. Loop:
   - Read frame
   - Detect faces with self.detector.detect()
   - For each face:
     - Crop face region (with padding)
     - Call self.recognize_face()
     - Draw bounding box (green if recognized, red if unknown)
     - Draw label with name and confidence
   - Show frame with cv2.imshow()
   - Break on ESC key
3. Release camera and close windows

**Reasoning:**
- Process each frame independently
- Padding around face improves embedding quality
- Color-coded boxes provide quick visual feedback
- ESC key for clean exit

**Test your implementation:**
```bash
python core/face_recognizer.py
# Expected: Webcam opens, recognizes faces in real-time
```

## 📦 Phase 4: Deployment (2-3 hours)

### 🧠 Concept: Edge Deployment

**Why deploy to Jetson Nano?**
- Standalone operation (no laptop needed)
- Lower power consumption
- Can integrate with robotics/IoT projects
- Real-world deployment experience

**ONNX optimization:**
- ONNX is platform-independent format
- TensorRT optimizes for NVIDIA GPUs
- 2-4x speed improvement on Jetson

### 📝 Implementation Part A: ONNX Export

**File:** `deployment/jetson_inference.py`

**Your Task:** Deploy to Jetson Nano.

**Note:** For most students, you can use `core/face_recognizer.py` directly on Jetson! It works out of the box. See the deployment file for complete step-by-step instructions including:
- Transferring project to Jetson
- Installing dependencies
- Running recognition
- GPU acceleration (optional)
- Arduino integration (optional)

**Deployment Steps (Summary):**
1. Copy project to Jetson
2. Install dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `python3 core/face_recognizer.py` (yes, the same file!)
4. Optional: Enable GPU with `device='cuda'`
5. Optional: Add Arduino serial communication

For complete instructions, see `deployment/jetson_inference.py`

---

## 🔧 Configuration

**File:** `configs/config.yaml`

All settings in one place:

```yaml
# Model settings
model:
  name: "buffalo_l"              # InsightFace model pack
  device: "cpu"                  # "cpu" or "cuda"

# Recognition settings  
recognition:
  similarity_threshold: 0.6      # Adjust based on accuracy needs
  
# Camera settings
camera:
  device_id: 0                   # Default webcam
  resolution: [640, 480]
  
# Paths
paths:
  reference_embeddings: "models/reference_embeddings.npy"
  label_names: "models/label_names.txt"
```

**Tuning the threshold:**
- 0.8+ = Very strict (almost no false positives, but may miss some)
- 0.6 = Balanced (recommended)
- 0.4 = Lenient (fewer misses, but more false positives)

---

## 📊 Testing & Debugging

### Test 1: Model Loading
```bash
python test_model.py
# Should: Load model, extract embedding, show shape [512]
```

### Test 2: Reference Database
```bash
python test_embeddings.py  
# Should: Show reference embeddings shape, label names, similarity matrix
```

### Test 3: Real-Time Recognition
```bash
python core/face_recognizer.py
# Should: Open webcam, recognize faces in real-time
```

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: "No face detected"**
- Check lighting (need good light)
- Face should be at least 50x50 pixels
- Face should be roughly front-facing
- Try adjusting detection threshold

**Issue 2: "Low recognition accuracy"**
- Capture more photos per person (30+)
- Ensure varied angles and lighting during capture
- Adjust similarity threshold
- Check if embeddings are normalized

**Issue 3: "Slow performance"**
- Reduce camera resolution
- Use GPU if available (ctx_id=0)
- Consider ONNX export for optimization
- Close other applications
